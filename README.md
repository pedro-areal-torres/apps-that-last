# ðŸ›’ Apps that last

This project was built in the context of my article on Medium: **[Building apps that last: React beyond the syntax](#https://medium.com/@pedrogarealtorres/building-apps-that-last-react-beyond-the-syntax-fa3d4cad0255)**

This repository serves as a **reference implementation** of the principles described in _Tao of React_ by Alex Kondov â€” brought to life in a real-world, easy-to-understand domain: a supermarket.

The goal is not just to write working code, but to write **code that lasts** â€” modular, maintainable, and scalable React applications that other developers won't be afraid to touch six months from now.

> This project is not focused on having a polished or beautiful UI.  
> Its purpose is to showcase clean architecture, thoughtful abstractions, and long-term maintainability.
